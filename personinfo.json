#What I understood From the above task:

#The JSON object contains an array of people, which is represented as square brackets [ ]. Each person is an object, represented by curly braces {}.

#Each person object has keys for their information such as firstName, lastName, age, address, and contactDetails.
#The value for each key is given as a string (e.g. "Abhijeet"), number (e.g. 25), 
#The key-value pairs are separated by a colon (:) and each key-value pair is separated by a comma (,).

//# Q. Can you alter the json object to include two addresses such as your home/current address and a permanent address? Additionally, instead of using a single "contact" object in an array, consider creating multiple objects for each type
